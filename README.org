* System Evaluator

Clone with ~--recursive~.

** Quick Start

Build and boot the VM:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make -C system qemu
#+END_SRC

This might take some time the first time as it builds the kernel and installs Debian.

In another terminal:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./bench/run.sh --suite default
#+END_SRC

The latter also installs all benchmark dependencies on the system.
