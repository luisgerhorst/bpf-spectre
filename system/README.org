* System Builder

** Physical SuT Setup

*** sudo

Requires sudo without a password (on the target only), for I4 lab add the following to FAI config:

#+BEGIN_SRC txt
# Luis Gerhorst
gerhorst faui49easy*=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
#+END_SRC

*** Wake-on-LAN

SSH config must auto-wake the target SuT using WoL if it is suspended, for I4 lab add the following to ~~/.ssh/config~:

#+BEGIN_SRC txt
# On the control system.

Host i4lab1*
	Hostname i4lab1.informatik.uni-erlangen.de
	ProxyJump none

Host i4lab2*
	Hostname i4lab2.informatik.uni-erlangen.de
	ProxyJump none

Match originalhost faui49* exec "bash -c 'ssh i4lab1 wake %n | grep --invert-match failed'"
	Hostname %h.cs.fau.de
	Port 22
	ProxyJump i4lab1
#+END_SRC

*** Evaluation Mode

Reserve the target for exclusive access and disable automatic (re-)configuration, for example:

#+BEGIN_SRC txt
# If supported:
set-system-mode evaluation

# Fallback:
sudo systemctl disable fai-boot.timer'
sudo systemctl disable run-fai.timer'

# Undo:
set-system-mode normal
sudo systemctl enable run-fai.timer
sudo systemctl enable fai-boot.timer
#+END_SRC

** Quick Start

Boot the VM (or boot the real target):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make qemu
#+END_SRC

Other terminal:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make all
#+END_SRC

The latter installs the required software on the target system under test and ensures that the kernel checked out in the subdirectory is booted. That is, the system is ready for evaluation. May be called repeatedly by bench-scripts to evaluate different configurations.

** Related Work

Could maybe be in part simplified / replaced with something like ~salt~ or ~cfengine~.
