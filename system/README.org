* System Builder

** Quick Start

Boot the VM (or boot the real target):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make qemu
#+END_SRC

Other terminal:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
make all
#+END_SRC

The latter installs the required software on the target system under test and ensures that the kernel checked out in the subdirectory is booted. That is, the system is ready for evaluation. May be called repeatedly by bench-scripts to evaluate different configurations.

** Related Work

Could maybe be in part simplified / replaced with something like ~salt~ or ~cfengine~.
